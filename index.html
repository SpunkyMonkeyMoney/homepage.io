The Path I Follow, My Egocentric Perspective, and The Realization That Forms
That rock, that walk, my block. It’s just the surface of my life. The air, the wind, the rain, my pain. It’s just the surface of my face. The birds, the people, my environment. It’s just the surface of the feelings I have. That path, although cracked, is a mirror. If someone looked at a mirror, are they reflected or a twisted reflection of my own face and theirs? The path I follow, People look and see, just the surface of me. They look, they watch, they judge. Admiration is silly, when derived from sight, not love. When people look up to me, and see a shining star, they see me at a distance, they see me from afar. When I fall, who will pick me up? In the streets, I’ve cried, no luck. Just stares, who cares? When you never talk, your a wall, not glass, though luck. Despite all that, those who see, might fret. They may help, while you are left to wail and “yelp!”. Like a dog, I’ve lived; I’ve pulled, no give. The man, he listened to me, but I was never taught, let free. Just the surface?! I don’t deserve this! Why is the path I walk, when looking at the rain, it’s just the surface of my pain. Rain, snow, wind, their chaos feels akin. My mom, she loved, she yelled. Like the rain, my pain was her wind singing it’s air about. Unbound by lips, she threw it, she whipped. Uncoaxed, unsense, like the chaos of the rain it went. Unable to cope, I lost hope, it became a pain, I associate with rain. When I look at others, all I see is twisted brothers. Their faces, their motion, they all hum to a beat of one single notion. Like a woman I met, which she confirmed as she left, that all people care about is convenience. In our “public lu”, she dropped her dog's poo, without a care for the world, she dropped it and turned. With a face of disgust, I looked at her and saw, her face looking at me with a shock of horror, of aw. I knew it I said, but this thought stayed in my head, it was a time of work not thinking about that old lady’s quirks. Why is my walk, the people, the plants, just another feeling on the surface?
I’ll tell you that answer but I’ll only spell it out once, I’m narrow minded. All these lines are my perspective, my feelings about the world. Whenever I encounter a new scenario all I remember is the perspective of myself shown through others, my whole world is like a giant interrelated web that results in the strengthening of a few specific principles. Those principles become reflected by people, by EVERYTHING, giving me a feeling of a mirror. This leaves me with a few choices once I realized this but many I didn’t find appealing. What should I’ve done?
The answer lies in a song I watched called “Die Young” by Kesha on Vivzepop’s channel, and the lyrics, “let’s make the most of the night like we're gonna die young”. As a young person with no incentive to be time sensitive but still wants to make the most of my life, this song gives me so much. When I think of the lines,“let’s make the most of the night like we're gonna die young”, it makes me think, live life presently and to its fullest instead of focusing on the future (side comment: I know that looking at the future is important because that’s what every present compounds and leads up to but sometimes thinking about how life can be lived to the fullest in that moment can change and move your target of the future in a more personal direction). The song also makes me realize I should not think of my environment through such a colapsive view like my experience with the lady, and that I shouldn’t care about it as much because it ruined my experience. Perhaps I could have told the lady that our trash can, our “public lu”, was in fact private.  This is just my perspective though, which leads me to my main point. Our perspective determines our experience of life, and if we are open, our experience changes. Finally, because I changed my perspective, I’ve glimpsed the block I’ve missed.
